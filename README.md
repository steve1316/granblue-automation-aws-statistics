Granblue Automation Statistics aims to provide users who choose to opt-in valuable information regarding which Farming Modes and Raids have been popular with what and how many item drops the user and others have been getting.

How it works is every time the Loot Collection process detects 1 or more item drops after a run, it will send a POST request to the MongoDB cluster and add a new entry into the specific Farming Mode table with the following information:

-   Your unique user id (generated by GA/GAA).
-   The amount of items acquired for this run.
-   The current date and time.

Back to the website, you can choose to display all runs provided by opt-in users for a particular Farming Mode's item in a table, display it as a chart, and sort/filter.
